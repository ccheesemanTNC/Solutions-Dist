 * Hash of the team group templates.
 * This hash is used to determin what teams can be created in what products

 * We define the various groups via json structures. The .config hash controls
 * the i18n, as well as the portal vs ago, and basic vs premium definition.
 * This allows us to add/remove/edit groups by simply modifying this hash
 * instead of spreading complex construction logic all over the application
